MeuBaz is a website to sell my own things

It's just a toy example for exercising in the world of Python + Django after finishing a course about that.

This website was made using django 1.11 and python 3.6, and deployed to a free account in Heroku.

There are two apps: core and catalog (for now).

Core is for the generic things used like: pagination, static files and; index and base html.

Catalog is for the Products and Category objects and their respective methods and attributes.

In this toy example I was able to exercise among other things:

- Pagination;
- Class Based Views: ListView, TemplateView, DetailView
- Model fields and custom methods: CharField, EmailField, SlugField, IntegerField, etc.
- Forms and Email Console Backend (POST)
- Unit Test with Django (Automated Tests)
- Managing Static Files
- Editing the django admin enviroment
- Context Processors
- Queries and  QuerySets
- Template Language
- Django urls (named and non-named groups)
